### Section: Context 
We are now in Unit 2, which focuses on GitHub, Git, and the command line. So far, we have primarily discussed the command line. The command line was essentially about using code to create folders and arrange them. It was easy to understand because the lessons were straightforward and not overly complex. 

#### Basics of Command Line Interface:
* â†‘ (up arrow): Scrolls through the command history (previous commands entered in the terminal).
* Tab: Auto-completes file or directory names (based on what's available in the current directory).
* `clear`: Clears the terminal screen, without deleting anything.
* `..`: Refers to the parent directory (one level up).
* ~: Represents the home directory of the current user.
* /: Represents the root directory of the filesystem.
* `pwd`: Prints the current working directory (shows the full path).
* `ls`: Lists files and directories in the current directory.
* `cd`: Changes the current directory to the specified directory.
* `mkdir`: Creates a new directory.
* `rmdir`: Removes an empty directory.
* `touch`: Creates a new, empty file or updates the timestamp of an existing file.
* `rm`: Removes (deletes) a file.
* `rm -rf`: Forcefully removes a directory and its contents, without confirmation prompts.
* `mv` (to rename): Renames a file or directory.
* `mv` (to move): Moves a file or directory to a new location.
